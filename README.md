# LeetCode Problem Solving Repository

## Overview

This repository contains my structured solutions to problems solved on LeetCode as part of my preparation for technical interviews and campus placements.

Each problem is organized using the format:

<problem-number>-<problem-name>

Example:
11-container-with-most-water
121-best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock
42-trapping-rain-water

This numeric-first structure allows fast lookup, easy revision, and scalable organization as the repository grows.


## Objective

The goal of this repository is not just to solve problems, but to:

- Strengthen core Data Structures and Algorithms fundamentals
- Master common interview patterns
- Improve optimization thinking
- Build clean, readable, interview-ready code
- Develop consistency and discipline in daily practice


## Technical Focus Areas

- Arrays and Strings
- Two Pointer Technique
- Sliding Window
- Binary Search
- Bit Manipulation
- Stack and Queue
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Greedy Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming (in progress)
- Trees and Graphs (in progress)


## Coding Principles Followed

For every problem, I ensure:

- Clear understanding of constraints
- Brute force identified first (when applicable)
- Optimized solution implemented
- Time Complexity analyzed
- Space Complexity analyzed
- Edge cases handled
- Clean and readable code structure

Example comment format inside solution files:

// Time Complexity: O(n)
// Space Complexity: O(1)
// Pattern Used: Two Pointers


## Repository Highlights

- Structured and scalable folder organization
- Problem-number-based indexing for quick navigation
- Solutions written with interview explanation clarity in mind
- Continuous improvement of earlier solutions when better approaches are discovered


## Sample Problems Included

11  - Container With Most Water
121 - Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
42  - Trapping Rain Water
125 - Valid Palindrome
167 - Two Sum II
190 - Reverse Bits
15  - 3Sum


## Practice Strategy

1. Understand problem constraints thoroughly
2. Attempt solution independently
3. Optimize approach step-by-step
4. Compare alternative methods
5. Revisit difficult problems for retention


## Growth Mindset

This repository represents:

- Consistency over intensity
- Depth over quantity
- Understanding over memorization
- Continuous self-improvement
